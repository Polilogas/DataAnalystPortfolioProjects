# Data Analyst Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio Projects repository! Here, I showcase my skills in SQL and Excel through three distinct folders.

In this folder, I demonstrate my proficiency in SQL with real-world data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It contains:

- **SQL File:** Utilized to analyze and manipulate COVID-19 data.
- **Excel Files:** Additional data files used for analysis and visualization.

Within this folder, I exhibit my expertise in data cleaning techniques using SQL. Here's what you'll find:

- **SQL File:** Employed for cleaning and preprocessing datasets.

- **Excel File:** A supplementary dataset utilized for data cleaning tasks.

Please note that this project serves as a demonstration of my capabilities and may not reflect perfection. It's a testament to my ability to handle data effectively.

In this folder, I showcase my proficiency in data cleaning and analysis using Excel, but with certain limitations:

- Excel File: Contains cleaned data and pivot tables for analysis.

While I intended to create a dashboard for comprehensive visualization, constraints with my current tool, LibreOffice, limited its scope. Nonetheless, this project highlights my ability to perform data tasks within the confines of available resources.
